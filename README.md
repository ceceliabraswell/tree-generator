# Tree Generator

This project is an enhanced version of the Pyramid Generator I originally built for the JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures course on freeCodeCamp. The initial project, built with JavaScript, generated a pyramid using the '#' symbol. I expanded its functionality by incorporating HTML and CSS, transforming the design to resemble the shape of a Christmas tree

## What I learned by building this project?

Building this project deepened my understanding of JavaScript for loops. Iâ€™m excited to continue improving my JavaScript skills, with the goal of refining this code to make it cleaner and more efficient
